cannot import name X from partially initialized module: 
    Error due to naming conflicts or circular imports

module not found:
    module not found    

3 BIG BUG CATEGORIES :
    1 - Environment issues
    2️ - Import / configuration issues
    3️ - Runtime logic issues

    ENVIRONMENT ISSUES (“Setup” Problems): Problems caused by where or how your code is running, not the code itself.
        HOW TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENT ERRORS:
            Ask: “If I copy this code to another machine, would it still fail?”
                If yes → environment issue
        
        WHAT TO THINK:
            Think:
                - Python version
                - Virtual environment
                - Installed packages
                - OS differences
                - Missing services (Redis, Postgres)
            
            Common signs
                Errors like:
                    - ModuleNotFoundError
                    - No module named 'xyz'
                    - command not found
                    - python is not recognized
                    - Connection refused

            Examples:
                - Celery installed globally but not in venv
                - Redis not running
                - Wrong Python version
                - .env not loaded

            🛠 Typical fix approach
                - Activate venv
                - Install missing package
                - Start required service
                - Fix PATH or env variables

    Import / Configuration Issues (The “Wiring” Problems): Your code exists, but things are connected wrongly
        Errors like:
            - ImportError
            - partially initialized module
            - ImproperlyConfigured
            - settings are not configured
            - AppRegistryNotReady


        Examples:
            - Wrong DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
            - Naming conflict (celery, django.py, jwt.py)
            - Circular imports
            - App not added to INSTALLED_APPS
        
        Ask: 
            “Is this failing before my app even starts?”
            If yes → import/config issue

        🛠 Typical fix approach:
            - Check file paths in traceback
            - Check project/app names
            - Check settings wiring
            - Check imports order
        
RUNTIME LOGIC ISSUES(The “Your Code” Problems):Your app starts successfully, 
    but something goes wrong while running.
    These are logic mistakes.

    Errors like:
        - TypeError
        - ValueError
        - AttributeError
        - DoesNotExist
        - IntegrityError
        - IndexError
        - KeyError

    Examples:
        - Calling a function wrong
        - Accessing missing object
        - Wrong queryset logic
        - Bad conditionals
        - Off-by-one errors
    
    How to recognize fast:
        Ask:
            “Did the server start fine, then crash when I hit an endpoint?”
            If yes → runtime logic issue
    
    🛠 Typical fix approach

        - Print/debug values
        - Read error line carefully
        - Test assumptions
        - Write small tests

    Final Debugging Rule (Write This Down)
        - Don’t fix bugs. Classify them first: Fixing comes naturally after that.

    Why This Classification Is Powerful

    Once you classify:
        -You don’t panic
        -You don’t reinstall randomly
        -You don’t rewrite code unnecessarily
        -You move directly to the right layer.

        That’s senior behavior.

    Finally:

        Ultra-Fast Classification Cheat Sheet: When you see an error, ask these in order:

            Question 1

                -Did the app fail to start?
                    - Yes → Environment or Import
                    - No → Runtime logic

            Question 2

                - Is Python complaining about missing things?
                - Packages, commands, services → Environment
                - Modules, settings, imports → Import/Config

            Question 3

                Did my code logic cause this?

                - Wrong data
                - Wrong function usage
                - Wrong assumptions → Runtime logic


            Apply This to Your Celery Bug

            Let’s classify it properly:

                App failed to start ✅

                Error was during import ✅

                Traceback showed wrong module path ✅

                👉 Import / configuration issue

                Not environment. Not logic.
