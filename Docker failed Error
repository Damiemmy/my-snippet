    -problem:slow network causing Docker Desktop froze. it might also be a Disk/cache issues,BuildKit lost track of its “lease” while exporting layers due to slow network,So by the time Docker tries to export the image, the lease is already gone → 💥 build fails.
    -solution:add dockerignore files to reduce unneccessary exports,solution 2 faster network to export before lease is no more
