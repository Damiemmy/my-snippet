NOTE: for slow networks that may cause failure in building(four things are suggested) to run docker smoothly
    note: before carrying any of this two solutions you must ensure python version in dockerfile is pulled  e.g docker pull python:3.11, docker pull python:3.10, docker pull python:3.12
        1- docker pull image-name(it only works if there's no "build" included in it) e.g docker pullredis 8.4.0, docker pull postgres:15,docker pull python
         - docker compose build service-name(it only works if the service has "build" )e.g celery service, django service
         - docker compose up -d service-name(to run each container it works for both build and pull services)
         - docker compose up -d --build service-name(to build and run each container with the providede service name but note, it only works for services with "build",for other services like redis and postgres you will have to pull the image first and run "docker compose up -d service name")

        2- finally if you get such error below e.g
            Error:
                Error response from daemon: failed to resolve reference "docker.io/library/redis:8.4.0": failed to do request: Head "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/redis/manifests/8.4.0": net/http: TLS handshake timeout
            solution : in Settings → Docker Engine
                Add (or confirm):
                    {
                    "max-concurrent-downloads": 1,
                    "max-concurrent-uploads": 1
                    }
                Save & restart Docker.
                This slows downloads but prevents EOF errors.
            Finall Note: solution 2 is the list recommended, solution one should work well if implimented correctly
            -acronym of EOF means-End Of File

-Error: pg_config executable not found.
    -Problem:pg_config is required to build psycopg2 from source.
    -solution:use psycopg2-binary

-Error:JSONArgsRecommended: JSON arguments recommended for CMD to prevent unintended behavior related to OS signals
    -problem: single quotes ('') Error (json does not understand single quotes)
    -solution: replace single quotes with double quotes("")

-Error:Export[django/celery] exporting to image 385060s                                                                           
    target celery: failed to solve: mount callback failed on /var/lib/desktop-containerd/daemon/tmpmounts/containerd-mount624012122: mount callback failed on /var/lib/desktop-containerd/daemon/tmpmounts/containerd-mount3220187345: failed to open writer: lease does not exist: not found
    -problem:slow network causing Docker Desktop froze. it might also be a Disk/cache issues,BuildKit lost track of its “lease” while exporting layers due to slow network,So by the time Docker tries to export the image, the lease is already gone → 💥 build fails.
    -solution:add dockerignore files to reduce unneccessary exports,solution 2 faster network to export before lease is no more
