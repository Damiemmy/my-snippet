3️⃣ Do ALL backend work inside WSL

Python

Django

DRF

Celery

Docker

Git

Nginx (for practice)

4️⃣ Use VS Code with WSL Extension

This gives you:

Linux terminal

Windows UI

Best of both worlds

🧪 Docker & WSL (Important)

Docker works best on Windows with WSL.

This aligns perfectly with:

	-AWS

	-Production servers

	-CI/CD pipelines

❌ When You SHOULD Switch Fully to Linux

Only if:

You enjoy Linux deeply

You do low-level systems programming

You manage servers daily

You’re a DevOps engineer

Otherwise — not required.

🧠 Final Verdict (Clear & Honest)

Do NOT change your OS.
Do NOT dual boot.
Use Windows + WSL + Ubuntu.
This is the smart, professional, modern choice.




1️⃣ Windows vs Linux — the reality (2026 standard)

Most production servers (AWS, DigitalOcean, GCP) run on Linux.
So as a backend engineer, Linux knowledge is mandatory — but Linux as your daily OS is optional.

Many excellent engineers:

Develop on Windows

Deploy to Linux servers

Use Linux tools through WSL

2️⃣ The BEST option for you (strong recommendation)
✅ Use Windows + WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This gives you:

A real Ubuntu Linux environment

Native access to Linux commands

No dual-boot stress

No driver issues

Ability to switch anytime

📌 With WSL, you are not “converting” — you’re adding Linux to Windows.

This is the most common setup for backend engineers in 2025–2026.

3️⃣ When should you fully switch to Linux?

Switch your entire OS only if:

Your PC struggles with Windows

You enjoy Linux daily

You’re doing low-level systems work

You want maximum performance on weak hardware

Otherwise, WSL is enough.

4️⃣ What matters more than OS (truth)

Your skills, not your OS, make you a professional.

These matter more:

Linux command line confidence

Git fluency

Docker knowledge

Debugging skills

Reading documentation

System thinking

📌 A strong engineer on Windows > a weak engineer on Linux.

5️⃣ What I recommend for YOU specifically

Based on your journey (Django, DRF, Docker, AWS, Celery):

🔥 Do THIS:

Stay on Windows

Install WSL (Ubuntu LTS)

Do all backend work inside WSL

Use VS Code connected to WSL

Deploy to Linux servers confidently

This matches real-world backend workflows.

6️⃣ Skills you must learn inside Linux (WSL)

Practice these until they feel normal:

cd, ls, chmod, chown

nano, vim

systemctl

journalctl

SSH keys

Environment variables

Nginx

Gunicorn / Uvicorn

Docker CLI

If you can do these, your OS no longer matters.

7️⃣ Simple analogy

Windows = your office desk

Linux = the factory where real work happens

You don’t need to sleep in the factory —
but you must know how to work there confidently.

8️⃣ Clear final verdict

✔ Stay on Windows
✔ Install and master WSL
✔ Learn Linux deeply
❌ No need to dual boot now
❌ No need to “convert” your OS(operating system)


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN git switch -c dev and git checkout -b dev

they only achieve the same thing in term of branches alone,git switch was introduce for the purpose of
Safety:

	- git switch is safer
	- It prevents accidental file overwrites
	- Git introduced it to reduce beginner mistakes

this is what git checkout -b dev does:

	- git checkout can:
	- switch branches
	- create branches
	- restore files
	- detach HEAD
	- overwrite working files
	
git switch only handles branches — nothing else.
